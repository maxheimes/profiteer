# Profiteer

Profiteer is a game coded in Python 3.7 for my A Level Coursework. The majority of it makes use of the pygame library.

## Scope
The plan for this game is inspired by Stick War and Cookie Clicker. Gameplay will consist of players having to balance buying money making products, as well as buying units for defence/attack. The more money you end the game with, the better. After the game the money earned can be used to buy upgrades for units and buildings.
## Win Conditions

- Your oponent be left with no units and no money/money making facilities
- In the event of a draw the player ending with the most money wins.
