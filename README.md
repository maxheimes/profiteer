# Profiteer

Profiteer is a game coded in Python 3.7 for my A Level Coursework. The majority of it makes use of the pygame library.

## Scope
The plan for this game is inspired by Stick War and Cookie Clicker. Gameplay will consist of players having to balance buying money making products, as well as buying units for defence/attack. The more money you end the game with, the better.
## Installation

To install Profiteer clone this git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxheimes/profiteer/
```
